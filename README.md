# What is it?

Admin alert is a FiveM chat message script that allows staff members in your server to send an announcement in chat to all players. It uses Badgers DiscordAcePermissions which is configured by groups, all info can be found in the README within the ZIP.

# How do install and configure it?

All information is in the README.txt within the ZIP, please read before asking questions.

# What do I need to make it work?

You need to have Badgers DiscordAcePermissions and BadgerDiscordAPI to have all permissions fully working, do not complain that the script does not work if you have not set this up first. Beware, I do not give support for Badgers scripts, if it is not working please read his docs or contact his support team.
